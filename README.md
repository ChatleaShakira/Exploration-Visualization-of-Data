# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
## Exploration and Visualization of Social Media Data on Twitter with the Keyword “Tiket Borobudur"
\
Data Exploration & Visualization is one of the elective courses in the Statistics program at the University of Indonesia that I took in my second semester. This course is designed to enable students to explore and visualize data using various techniques and methods, using open-source software, and to analyze data descriptively to gain useful insights.\
\
Borobudur Temple is a Buddhist temple located in Magelang, Central Java. The temple was built around the 8th century AD by the followers of Mahayana Buddhism. Borobudur is the largest Buddhist monument in the world and has been designated by UNESCO as a world cultural heritage. This makes Borobudur Temple a popular tourist destination among domestic and foreign tourists. Recently, the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment of Indonesia, Luhut Binsar Panjaitan announced a plan to increase the entrance fee to Borobudur Temple. For both domestic and foreign tourists.\

**Method:**
1. Retrieving data from [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/elevated), namely 1000 tweets that contain the keyword “Tiket Borobudur”, we have saved the tweet in txt format [Tweets.txt](https://github.com/ChatleaShakira/Exploration-Visualization-of-Data/blob/bc52881ecd104ca81d862f59efe5ea249e82e764/Tweets.txt)
2. Preprocessing: replacing slang, removing words that appear frequently but do not have a significant impact, and others (removing stopwords)
3. Visualization with Voyant Online:\
   a. Cirrus\
   b. Table\
   c. Trends\
   d. Links\
   e. Word Tree

**Conclusion:**
\
The topic that our group raised in this project is about the plan of Minister Luhut Panjaitan to increase the entrance fee to Borobudur Temple. This plan has received a lot of criticism from the public, from the 1000 tweets that we collected, it is proven by looking at the visualization that there are several keywords that appear most often are “borobudur”, “tiket”, “candi”, “harga”, and “kenaikan”, besides the keywords that appear most often, terms such as: “ditunda”, “nyinyir”, “murah kelakuan wisatawan lokal kaya”, “protes” and others also appear quite often, proven by the visualization, these words are not too small in size. This indicates the resistance of the public to the government’s discourse on raising the entrance fee to Borobudur Temple.
